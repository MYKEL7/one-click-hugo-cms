Every week, some food stuff gets finished at home and towards the end, the empty cupboards and dusty pantry make it seem like you never went shopping early in the month. This cycle continues monthly and so does the stress. Busy moms can testify that this chore is mentally stressful and demanding too.  

Here is how you can make it rewarding.

2. Put them into categories. e.g. Cereals, Vegetables, grains.
3. Write down a list of items you need every month.
4. Upload your list to our app and check for prices.
