Every week, some food stuff gets finished at home and towards the end, the empty cupboards and dusty pantry make it seem like you never went shopping early in the month. This cycle continues monthly and so does the stress. Busy moms can testify that this chore is mentally stressful and demanding too.  

Here is how you can make it rewarding.

## Our little secrets of a good shopping Routine

Here’s three important tips you need to make that routine effortless:

1. Write down a list of all the food supplies you need monthly.
2. Put them into categories. e.g. Cereals, Vegetables, grains.
3. Write down a list of items you need every month.
4. Upload your list to our app and check for prices.

Our App will handle all of the reminders and you do not have to write your shopping list again. Just check our app and see what is finished and prompt us for a restock. Its that simple.
